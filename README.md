# DIMES_RAFOS_floats
Contains the scripts that I used while working with the DIMES RAFOS floats. Mostly for the circulation study.

Paper can be found here:

Sadly the scripts were written before I cared about sharing them online. So there is very few comments and very rudimentary organization to the material. Feel free to contact me if you want to use something on here. In some ways the purpose of this repository is to make sure that this work doesn't get lost in some hard disk crash.
